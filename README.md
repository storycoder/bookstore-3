I am doing this Tech Talent South lesson for the third time with the intention of instilling the habit of as-I-go documentation on my pull requests. 

I have created and master branch and another called working_pull_request_doc.

I will push all new work to working_pull_request_doc and document each activity as I go on a pull request to that branch that assign to @germs12. 

HI JAMES!!
